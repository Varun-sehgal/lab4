# EECS 230 Lab 4

In this lab, you will learn about `struct`s and `class`es in C++.

## Introduction to `struct`s and `class`es

 `struct`s and `class`es are user-defined types. They are used to abstract higher-level concepts representing domain
 knowledge. Thus, they are used to characterize a certain "thing" in a program. They can be used to represent abstract
 concepts of data, such as a certain piece of data. For instance, an MP3 file could be represented as a `class`, holding
 the following information: a Tag and Audio. The Tag could be represented as a `class`, containing the following
 data as `string`s: Name, Artist, Album, Genre, etc. The Audio could be represented as a `class`, containing the audio as a
 two-dimensional matrix of `double`s representing time and amplitude.
 
 We will focus on `struct`s in this lab because `class`es have some intricacies regarding access control, meaning that
  certain data inside a `class` can be protected or hidden from other parts of a program. A `struct` has all of its data
  public, meaning that everything can access the data inside a variable of the `struct` type. 
  
 The following shows the declaration of a `struct` representing a date:
 ```
 struct Date {
    int year;
    int month;
    int day;
    bool isAD;
 };
 ```
 As shown, a `struct` can have multiple data types as members. To declare a variable of the `Date` type and set its data:
 ``` 
 Date today;
 today.year = 2016;
 today.month = 1;
 today.day = 27;
 today.isAD = true;
 ```
 
 A `struct` can even have functions as members! As the above shows, setting data manually is tedious. So, there is a
 special function that can be added called a *constructor*. Simply name the function the same as the `struct` type name:
 ```
 struct Date {
    int year;
    int month;
    int day;
    bool isAD;
    Date(int y, int m, int d, bool AD)
    {
        year = y;
        month = m;
        day = d;
        isAD = AD;
    };
 };
 
 Date today(2016,1,27,true);
 ```
 
 > What could you do to improve the above constructor? (hint: what's wrong with accepting any input?)
 
 Chapter 9 of the book covers this topic, for more detailed information.

## Computational geometry review
1. Points (x,y)
2. 2DVectors ((x1,y1),(x2,y2))
3. 2DVector addition
4. 2DVector subtraction
5. 2DVector intersection

## Code up a program to do this!

1. Implement Points as structs, then 2DVectors as structs that have members of the Points type.
2. Implement 2DVector addition and subtraction, returning a new 2DVector for the resultant.
3. Implement a 2DVector intersection calculator.
